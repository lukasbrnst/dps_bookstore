## This is the DPS Bookstore

This is a very simple bookstore in context of the DPS challenge.

This small app is able to show added books and receive new entries.

It relies on the following structure and packages:
- python, flask back-end
- html + css template from jinja+pixel+lite
- mysql database (mariadb)
